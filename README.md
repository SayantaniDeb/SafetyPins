The path to perfect safety

## 💡Motivation 

Feeling safe is a basic human right. It's easy to be victim of the numerous wrongdoings or natural catastrophe while travelling on your own. 

## 📲What it does?

It fetches the traffic light data and navigates the user to the safest path to reach their destination. It also has built in sirens to alert people around incase of any discrepancies. Furthermore, it stores emergency contact numbers incase of emergencies who can be immediately contacted within a press of a key.
