It's time to take **safer** routes over shorter routes! <br>
You can find our app [here](https://apps.powerapps.com/play/f1ca9413-7ff1-4587-b112-8f29f917409a?tenantId=84c31ca0-ac3b-4eae-ad11-519d80233e6f)! (The app is shared with everyone in the MLSA organization)

## 💡Motivation 

- Approximately **one in every two women** feel unsafe walking on the roads after sunset. 
- Women are extra cautious while walking on the roads after sunset. All the cat-calling, the robbery of gold necklaces and kidnapping is something that makes roads very unsafe in the dark. 
- With the motivation of **reducing crime rates and making roads safer to walk**, this is an application designed provide a safer walking experience. 
- Feeling safe is a basic human right. It's easy to be victim of the numerous wrongdoings or natural catastrophe while travelling on your own.

## 📲What it does?

- **Navigation**: It uses the street light data and helps the user with the safest path to reach their destination. 
- **Emergency sirens**: It also has about 6 built in sirens to alert people around incase of any emergencies or when they would want to attract the attention of people in public.
- **Emergency contact**:Furthermore, it stores emergency contact numbers incase of emergencies, they can be immediately contacted within a press of a key.

## 🧠Challenges we ran into 

- This was our very first time working with a low code platform. It was a very significant learning curve for all the members of the team.
- We were all affected with COVID-19 at dfferent timeline of the project.
- Spent extra time to learn new concepts like embedding the maps to the app.
- We spent a lot of time looking for quality street light data.


## 🥇Accomplishments we are proud of
- This was our first time working on Microsoft PowerApps and ✨WE DID IT✨
- We were able to collaborate and work in harmony despite severe obstacles like different states, COVID-19 testing positive, side hustles.
- We were able to make it to the end as a team!

## 🚀Future Scope
- The navigation feature to be imporved according to the user's location.
- With more street light data, the limitation of the safety path can be expanded.
- We can expand the concept to open buildings at the time the user has been walking.
- We can integrate a like/dislike feature wherein we could get the user's feedback of whether the path was well lit and safe or not/
